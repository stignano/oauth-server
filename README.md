# oauth-server
Uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Users stored in MongoDB. Minimal front-end with routing.

Set up to automatically run in production or development environments. For local development, run with **npm run dev**.

Other strategies (Facebook, Github etc.) can be easily added.

*Note: back-end only. For a full-stack version, see my [full-stack-oath](https://github.com/tomierino/full-stack-oauth) repo.*
